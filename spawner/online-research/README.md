Structured web-research skill for running consistent, quality-checked investigation workflows.

## Files

- `skill.yaml` — core research process and task framing instructions.
- `sharp-edges.yaml` — known web-research pitfalls and failure modes.
- `collaboration.yaml` — collaboration rules for dividing and reconciling research work.
- `validations.yaml` — validation criteria for source quality and synthesis completeness.

## How it works

The skill breaks research into explicit stages so source gathering, analysis, and synthesis stay traceable. Sharp-edge guidance reduces common errors like weak sourcing, recency misses, and unsupported conclusions. Collaboration and validation rules ensure results can be reviewed and trusted before handoff.
