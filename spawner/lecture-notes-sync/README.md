# lecture-notes-sync

Patterns for aligning lecture recordings with structured notes and update passes.

## Files

- `skill.yaml` — main synchronization workflow and execution constraints.
- `sharp-edges.yaml` — known failure cases, ambiguity traps, and safety checks.
- `patterns.md` — practical note-sync patterns and formatting conventions.

## How it works

The skill defines a repeatable pass structure that maps recording segments to note sections. It uses pattern guidance to keep summaries consistent while preserving technical detail. Sharp-edge rules are applied to catch timestamp drift, missed transitions, and other synchronization errors before finalizing notes.
