# obsidian-cli

Deep reference skill for operating Obsidian CLI v1.12 with robust patterns, constraints, and architecture guidance.

## Files

- `skill.yaml` — primary workflow for Obsidian CLI usage and task routing.
- `sharp-edges.yaml` and `sharp-edges.md` — machine-readable and narrative sharp-edge catalogs.
- `patterns.md` and `anti-patterns.md` — recommended practices and common failure approaches to avoid.
- `decisions.md` — architectural decisions that explain why patterns are chosen.
- `validations.yaml` and `collaboration.yaml` — quality gates and multi-agent collaboration rules.

## How it works

This skill encodes an extensive operational playbook for Obsidian CLI rather than a single script. It combines pattern guidance, anti-pattern warnings, and decision records so behavior stays consistent across complex vault tasks. Validation and collaboration rules provide a final control layer for correctness and coordination.
